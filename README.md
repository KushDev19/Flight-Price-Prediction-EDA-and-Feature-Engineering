# Flight Price Prediction: EDA & Feature Engineering ✈️

A complete data science pipeline that analyzes and prepares flight data for machine learning models to predict ticket prices. From cleaning and visualization to advanced feature engineering—perfect for building accurate predictive models.

---

## 🔍 Highlights

- **Data Cleaning**  
  Detect and handle missing values, remove duplicates, standardize data types, and ensure consistency across the dataset.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Analyze distributions, trends, correlations, and outliers in features such as journey date, departure/arrival timing, duration, stops, airlines, sources, and destinations.

- **Feature Engineering**  
  - Extract meaningful information like journey month/day, departure/arrival hours and minutes  
  - Derive new attributes such as total stops count and route type  
  - Encode categorical data (e.g., airlines, source, destination)  
  - Scale or transform continuous variables to prepare for modeling :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

- **Insights**  
  Examine relationships like how booking time affects price, the impact of airline choice, and flight duration vs. fare.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Install dependencies**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Add your dataset**  
   Place your CSV file (e.g., `train.csv`, `test.csv`) into the `data/` folder.

3. **Launch the notebook**

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

4. **Follow the notebook workflow**  
   - Load data → Clean & preprocess → Visualize and explore → Engineer features → Prepare data for modeling
